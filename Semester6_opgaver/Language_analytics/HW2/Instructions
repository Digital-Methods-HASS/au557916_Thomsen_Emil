Download the file in this folder and uploaded to your notebook or src folder in your own jupitor notebook.
Then in the terminal, navigate to the file and activate it by typing "python collocate.py". (if you are working on windows, I am not sure what macs do.)
The program is using the corpus with the 100 english novels, so the path on in your jupitor notbook should be the same as in mine.
