#Meta data file for Abortions project 
  
##Project level metadata 
In this project we are studying the correlation between income and abortions per capita in the different municipalities in Denmark.The data is downloaded from public government owned websites and contain data from the timespan of 1995-2018. The interest for this project was inspired by the current events happening in Poland where there were riots because of the imposed law on nearly illegalization of abortions. Therefore, we wanted to look at the situation in Denmark and find out if there is a correlation between wealth and the number of abortions per capita. This we aimed to do by looking at the previously mentioned data and visualize it in a way that could give an understanding of how the correlation looks.
